# Pacaea
A file packer for Arcaea (Nintendo Switch).

## Compilation
In order to compile, you'll need to install [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/).

Once it is installed, you just have to run the following command:
```
haxe build.hxml
```

Afterwards, the compiled file will be in `bin/bin/Main.exe`.

## Usage
Set up a data folder next to `Main.exe` then run the executable. The packer will generate `arc.json` and `arc.pack`.
